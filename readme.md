Timer is just a way to execute a block of code, some periodic amount of time.
Timer allows you to do is take a closure, a lock of code, and execute it some time in the furture.and this is kind of not really real-time programming. This timer's not gonna go off exactly when you say. Timer go off the main queue.

Timer works with run loops.

timer.invalidate() // this tells the run to stop scheduling the timer.
